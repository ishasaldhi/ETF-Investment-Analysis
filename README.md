# ETF Investment Analysis

## Overview
In this project, I obtained financial data focusing on ETFs, Exchange-Traded Funds, in order to determine the best sectors for people to invest in. I chose ETFs due to their features including diversification, transparency, dividends, and lower costs. I analyzed the performance of the stock market to identify trends and make risk assessments. 

## Focus Questions
* How has the total return of ETFs changed over years?
* Which sector has performed the best over time?
* How stable has a fundâ€™s performance been?
* How many dividends have been received by investors?

## Components
* Creating a Python Flask-powered App
* Creating a database in Mongodb based on an API
* Connecting Mongodb to Flask app and jsonifying data
* Creating an HTML and JavaScript frontend

## Datasets
* Alpha Vantage adjusted Stock API

## Conclusion
* Most ETFs that mainly consisted of only one sector were very turbulent and risky.
* ETFs that incorporate various sectors showed the most stablilty.
* One sector that proved to be an exception was technology which showed a higher range for growth.
